    <section>
     <p>The gentle, intelligent and family-friendly Labrador Retriever from Canada continues to be the most popular
     breed in the United States, according to AKC registration statistics. 
     This versatile hunting breed comes in three colors - yellow, black and chocolate -
     and because of their desire to please their master they excel as guide dogs for 
     the blind, as part of search-and-rescue teams or in narcotics detection with law 
     enforcement</p>

      <p>As more and more pet parents look into what kinds of foods are going into their
        own bodies, it’s only natural to begin questioning the types of diets fed to their
        Labrador Retrievers – and making different choices.
        Manufactured, processed dog food has been the norm for generations of dog owners.
        It is convenient, has nutrients listed on the label for all to see, and keeps for 
        a long time in the pantry without refrigeration or freezing. On the negative side, 
        manufactured dog food is made with preservatives, binders, and emulsifiers – some of which 
        have been found to be detrimental to a Labrador’s health.
        If you choose to make your Lab’s meals yourself, you’ll want to learn as much about
        canine nutrition as possible, including how much of each nutrient to include in each meal, and how to get that with natural, organic foods.
        You’ll also want to decide if cooked or raw meals are on order for your pooch. 
        The proponents of “BARF,” or “Biologically Appropriate Raw Food,” say the diet – 
        consisting of raw meat, uncooked bones, and pulverized vegetables and fruit – 
        mimics what dogs would eat in the wild, and provides a more nutritious plan than 
        foods whose enzymes and amino acids have been altered by cooking.
        Opponents to this type of diet cite their concerns regarding the risk 
        of bacterial contamination and illness, dietary imbalances, and internal injury from un-chewed bones.</p>

     <p>Your Labrador wasn't born with the knowledge of what you want him to do, or don't want him to do.
        Your Lab wasn't born knowing the rules to living in a human world.
        Your Lab just doesn't know what you expect...
        And it's up to you to teach them!</p>
